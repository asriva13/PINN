# PINN

This folder contains PINN codes which employ, among other novelties, automatic satisfaction of boundary conditions. Based in part upon the paper

Sukumar, N., and Ankit Srivastava. "Exact imposition of boundary conditions with distance functions in physics-informed deep neural networks." Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering 389 (2022): 114333.

Second_Order_1D file contains the codes used to generate the 1D results in the paper.
